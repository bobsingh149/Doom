# Doom-AI
 AI that can play DOOM

# This AI was created using a combination of deep learning and Q-learning. It was able to use its previous experiences to come up with new and innovative ways to beat the game.

# How it works
- The AI was trained on a dataset of DOOM gameplay videos. The videos were used to teach the AI how to move around the environment, shoot enemies, and collect powerups. The AI was also given a reward for completing levels and a penalty for dying.

- The AI used Q-learning to learn how to make the best decisions in each situation. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn how to behave in an environment by trial and error. The AI would start by making random decisions, and then it would learn from its mistakes and make better decisions over time.

# Results
The AI was able to beat DOOM on the easiest difficulty setting. It was also able to beat some of the levels on the medium difficulty setting. The AI is still under development, but it has the potential to become a very powerful DOOM player.

# To run the AI
To run the AI, you will need to have a copy of DOOM installed. You can then run the ai.py script. The script will take a few minutes to run, and then the AI will start playing DOOM.
