# AI that can learn and beat DOOM game

This AI was created using a combination of deep learning and Q-learning. It was able to use its previous experiences to come up with new and innovative ways to beat the game.

# How it works
- The AI was trained on a dataset of DOOM gameplay videos. The videos were used to teach the AI how to move around the environment, shoot enemies, and collect powerups. The AI was also given a reward for completing levels and a penalty for dying.

- The AI used Deep Q-learning which is a combination of Deep learning and Q learning to learn how to make the best decisions in each situation. Deep Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn how to behave in an environment by trial and error. The AI would start by making random decisions, and then it would learn from its mistakes and make better decisions over time.

# Results
It was able to use its previous experiences to come up with new and innovative ways to beat the game.

# To run the AI
To run the AI, you will need to have a copy of DOOM installed. You can then run the ai.py script. The script will take a few minutes to run, and then the AI will start playing DOOM.
